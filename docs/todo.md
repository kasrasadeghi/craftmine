misc:
anti aliasing
negative world chunks
16^3 chunks instead of 16^2 x 128 chunks?
chunk load and unload from disk
background terrain gen
async instance gen
only instance gen for chunks that have neighbors
make transparency cache for chunk instance building?
make orthographic matrix depend on render distance
make shadow texture size depend on render distance
mipmap shadows
make better fog
texture interpolation instead of color interpolation
make text renderer draw on near plane
fix blocks placed on chunk boundary issues
inventory
day night cycle

class project:
water transparency
> DONE
3d noise texture
good shadow mapping
slightly blurred shadow mapping
functional shadow mapping
shadow mapping
use local isAir when possible in chunk instance building
chunk instance caching
octaves
phong shading
infinite terrain - make world load and unload chunks
glsl perlin texture
perlin noise
cull non-air-neighbor faces
render instances boxes
render boxes
camera integration
render box
investigate renderwindow non fullscreen
build with opengl
build


final:
advanced terrain gen - 3d perlin noise, air cutoff with gradient, cave digouts
investigate making glad a static lib
> DONE
