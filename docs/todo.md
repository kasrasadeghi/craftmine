misc:
anti aliasing
negative world chunks
16^3 chunks instead of 16^2 x 128 chunks?
chunk load and unload from disk
background terrain gen
async instance gen
only instance gen for chunks that have neighbors
make transparency cache for chunk instance building?
make orthographic matrix depend on render distance
make shadow texture size depend on render distance
mipmap shadows
make better fog
texture interpolation instead of color interpolation
make text renderer draw on near plane
fix blocks placed on chunk boundary issues
inventory
day night cycle
handle resizes
water transparency
investigate shadow volumes

final:
advanced terrain gen - 3d perlin noise, air cutoff with gradient, cave digouts
investigate making glad a static lib
