misc:
anti aliasing
negative world chunks
16^3 chunks instead of 16^2 x 128 chunks?
chunk load and unload from disk
background terrain gen
async instance gen
only instance gen for chunks that have neighbors
make transparency cache for chunk instance building?
make orthographic matrix depend on render distance
make shadow texture size depend on render distance
mipmap shadows
make better fog
texture interpolation instead of color interpolation
make text renderer draw on near plane
fix blocks placed on chunk boundary issues
inventory
day night cycle
handle resizes
water transparency
investigate shadow volumes
draw player
player shadow
investigate making glad a static lib

final:
advanced terrain gen - air cutoff with gradient, cave digouts
runescape less strong
extreme hill only sometimes
downsample with intelligent interpolation
incremental chunk generation
neighboring chunks on break refresh a lot
> DONE
incremental chunk building
fix player (collision?) crashing outside of chunk height bounds
stretch octaves
3d perlin
